# Pathfinding #

I got pathfinding mostly-working!



## Additional stuff... ##

Here's what's left:

  * Path smoothing
  * Performance issues, especially with targets moving quickly between nodes of the NavGraph

Further changes may be necessary...

  * Once the crab bug's leaping ability is implemented
  * In order to deal with an airborne opponent
